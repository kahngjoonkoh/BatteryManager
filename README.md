# BatteryManager
HP consumer laptops namely the Pavillion series do not have the battery health BIOS option. As charging up to 100% is detrimental for battery health, this Battery Manager will alert the user when the device is charged more than 80% so that the user can stop charging their laptop. Logs are taken which can be used to investigate unordinary behaviour.

## Usage:
Download main.exe and make it run every windows start using Windows Task Scheduler.

You can stop the program by having the first three characters of the log.txt file as 'hlt'.
